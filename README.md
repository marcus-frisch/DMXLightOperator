# LucentOperator

Hello and welcome to the exciting and open-source LucentOperator project.
**LucentOperator** also refered to as **LucentOP** is a event-driven, user customisable and flexible, cross platform software DMX controller.
While the main purpose of the project is to control and manipulate DMX enabled lighting systems, LucentOP may control any DMX enabled systems through the DMX512 protocol.
